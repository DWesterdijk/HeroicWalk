## About The Project

This is our first project for the Exams for our education.
We were asked to make a game for people with a handicap to encourage them to go out and exercise.

### Device Of Use

We decided to make the game available for on phone, it is the most accesible for our clients.

### Plan

Our plan was to make a game where they have to physically walk, and after a set amount of steps a pop up appears on their phone screen.
The pop up will tell them that there's an object they can interract with around them, they will be prompt with a yes/no question asking
if they want to open their camera so they can look around to find the AR object.

Upon finding the AR object they can scan it, doing so will grant bonus points next to the points obtained by walking.
The collected points can be used for character upgrades and vanity.

### Built With

The program will be developed and build with Unity Engine.
it is our most accesible engine and it brings us the easiest to use API's

## Getting Started

If you want to work on this there are some prerequisitions and installation steps.

### Prerequisites

We decided to use [ARFoundations](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.1/manual/index.html) in the [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/)
Our chosen IDE is [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

### Installation

Download your chosen IDE, or download our chosen IDE, [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

Download Unity Hub from the [Unity website](https://unity.com/)
Once the unity hub is downloaded install Unity Version 2019.4.20f1
In unity go to the packet manager and look up ARFoundations and hit install.

That should be all.
